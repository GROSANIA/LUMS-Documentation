            <h2>LUMS policy</h2>
            <p>The Library Use & Manage System's, also known as "LUMS" have a Guidelines that is crucial in maintaining the quality and integrity of the library's collection. It is the responsibility of all library users to respect these guidelines and help to maintain a safe and welcoming environment for all. The following guidelines outline the expectations and requirements for selecting and distributing books within the library:</p>
            <p>1. Racism and Harassment:</p>
            <p>The library strictly prohibits the inclusion of any content that promotes racism, sexism, or harassment. Books must not contain any material that is derogatory or demeaning towards any race, religion, gender, or ethnicity. It is essential to ensure that all library users feel respected and valued.</p>
            <p>2. Age-Appropriate Content:</p>
            <p>The library has established guidelines for age-appropriate content to cater to its diverse audience. Books must be suitable for their intended readership. The library will not tolerate the distribution of books that contain explicit or graphic content not suitable for minors. It is important to provide a safe and enriching experience for library users of all ages.</p>
            <p>3. Copyrighted Materials:</p>
            <p>Respecting copyright laws is crucial in maintaining the legal and ethical standards of the library. Books must not contain any copyrighted material used without proper permission from the owner. It is the responsibility of the library and its users to adhere to copyright regulations and respect intellectual property rights.</p>
            <p>4. Use of Curse Words:</p>
            <p>The library may impose restrictions on the use of curse words in written materials. While the library acknowledges that certain books may contain dialogue with curse words for artistic or contextual purposes, it requires that such words be modified to maintain a level of appropriateness. Specifically, the alphabet a, i, u, e, o in curse words should be replaced with #, $, or & while retaining the intended meaning. This ensures that books remain accessible to a wide range of library users while balancing artistic expression.</p>
            <p>5. Reporting Inappropriate Material:</p>
            <p>If you come across any material within the library's collection that you deem inappropriate or offensive, it is essential to report it promptly to the library staff. Library staff members are trained to handle such situations professionally and will investigate the matter accordingly. Reporting inappropriate material contributes to maintaining the library's integrity and ensuring a positive experience for all users.</p>
            <p>6. Responsibility of Library Users:</p>
            <p>All library users have a shared responsibility to uphold the guidelines outlined above and contribute to a safe and welcoming environment for everyone. It is important to be mindful of the content we choose and consume, treating others with respect and sensitivity. Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in the revocation of library privileges to ensure the well-being of the entire community.</p>
            <p>7. Returning Book:</p>
            <p>Guidelines for Returning Borrowed Books Promptly: All library users must return borrowed books within seven days from the borrowing date. Keep track of due dates, reborrow if needed, and return books properly. Late returns forces Administrator to UnBorrow, and your account might be banned for a few days or may even deleted.</p>
            <p>Conclusion:</p>
            <p>The Library Management System's "Appropriate Book" policy plays a vital role in fostering a safe, inclusive, and enriching environment for library users. By adhering to the guidelines regarding content selection and distribution, we can ensure that the library remains a valuable resource for all members of the community. Together, let us uphold these standards and promote an atmosphere of respect, diversity, and intellectual growth within the library.</p>
